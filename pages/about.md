# **About Me**

Hi I'm **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I translate ideas into appealing graphics and visuals, guiding clients to effectively communicate with their audiences.
At this time in my life, I’m interested in growing my career as an in-house creative, and wish to do more work with digital products and to continue to expand my breadth of media experience. I’m also interested in select freelance opportunities, and pro bono projects for causes and organizations I care about.
